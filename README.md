    How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    -In order to ensure that code is functional and secure, proper testing methods need to be implemented. These may include but are not limited to performing code review, running unit tests,  and performing automated testing. 
    How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    -An important part about interpreting user needs involves understanding how specific features of the design relate to the actual code. For example, knowing whether or not speed is important could influence what data structures are used. In respect to functionality, knowing what features the user wants helps determine what test cases to write.
    How do I approach designing software?
    -Software design should be approached with large focuses on providing functionality, efficiency, and security. Code must maintain a high degree of quality, follow industy standards, be as bug free as possible, and prevent external intrusions to the system. The code must also accomplish all tasks that are required of it.
